As most people, I am a well-balanced ambivert, engaging in a range of intraverted and extraverted hobbies. From a young age, I studied music, played the piano and a flute, sang in choirs, and rehearsed dramatic operettas. Similarly, my parents would frequently take me to the theater to listen to operas, orchestras and musicals. To this day, I am blown away by passionate professional musicians and their dedication to this incredible craft. 

Born and raised in Canada, I grew up in a Russian-speaking community and attended Russian school on Saturday every single week for eight years to learn my native language and to better understand my culture. I have also polished my French knowledge over the last 13 years and was delighted to speak the language every day when I studied in Switzerland on exchange. During COVID-19, I started learning Dutch and have visited the Netherlands a number of time (and taken several pictures, such as the canal above)! I am also very grateful to my parents for giving me the opportunity to travel and study around the world. I enjoy learning about local cultures, traditions, and history. I am a frequent museum and art gallery viewer. 

Last, but not least, I love to spend time in nature. Walking, hiking, and exploring forests and mountain brings me great joy and a peace of mind. I am also an avid skier, having skied in Colorado, Utah, Alberta, British Columbia, France, Austria, and Switzerland.

Here's a picture of my skiing in Zermatt, Switzerland!
