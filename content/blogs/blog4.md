I am so elated to be studying my Master's in Financial Analysis at the London Business School, on my way to jump-start my career in investment banking. 

Having completed my International Bachelor of Business Administration at the Schulich School of Business in Toronto, I was very interested in expanding my horizons and going abroad for my postgraduate degree. During my undergrad, I completed two exchanges in Oslo, Norway and in Lausanne, Switzerland. Meeting people from all over Europe and experiencing a rigorous, case-based academic system, encouraged me to continue my education in London. 

London Business School will provide an exceptional platform for me to acquire new knowledge from the world's leading professors, apply my skills in case-based experiencial education projects such as the London Business Challenge week, and to create a network that will last a lifetime. During my year, I also hope to travel throughout the UK and Europe, visit as many museums as possible, and trek through infamous national parks. Here's an image of the Besseggen Ridge hike I completed on the weekend while studying in Norway.
