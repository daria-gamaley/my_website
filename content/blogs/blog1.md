My professional background includes a diverse portfolio of roles across industries and functions. My first job was working at my family's structural engineering business, where I started with organising files and finished with a client-facing accounts management role. Working with the team for over 6 years, it has been incredible to witness the physical and financial expansion of the company. It was also very rewarding to see the impact I could have in a small business and the value we brought to a number of companies. This experience motivated me to work in a position where I will be helping people achieve their dream goals. Here's a photo of my dad in front of one of his projects!

Previously working as a Research and Teaching Assistant at the university, I have always been interested in learning about new industries, professions, and people. After my internship at the Royal Bank of Canada this winter, I developed a new interest in renewable energy and sustainable infrastructure. I am interested in projects that help improve the quality of living for communities around the world, as well as our ecological footprint. This summer, I participated in an internship focusing on hydrogen production, distribution, and consumption. It was very insightful to learn about new clean-technologies and how they can be implemented over the next several decades. My current goal is to work at an investment bank, where I can facilitate breakthrough deals in the energy industry. 

Here is a glimpse of my LBS CV.
